My name is John Dostal. I work for a John Deere Dealership as an IT Specialist. I am our company’s Microsoft Power Platform subject matter expert. I’ve been with the company about 2 years and before this I worked as the Senior Technician for the internal IT Helpdesk at First Merchants Bank. I’m majoring in Computer Science but I’m primarily taking classes that align with the duties of my job. This class is one example of that. Thanks to my current role, I have quite a bit of experience with databases. While I do interact with them on a daily basis, creating a new database and the design process are something I know very little about. I also am just now learning about the structural/schema fundamentals involved with databases and have yet to really dive into a particular version of SQL beyond being able to read the basic instructions. Based on the course description, I am hoping to learn more about these types of concepts. Data modeling, design, and querying is the main item I am looking forward to learning more about, but I am also looking forward to learning more about managing large and distributed databases as well. This is because I am the database administrator for our company as well. I like to end these discussion posts with a question to help make things easier for everyone, so with that in mind, what has been one example where someone used a spreadsheet or file in place of a database that did not go as planned?
